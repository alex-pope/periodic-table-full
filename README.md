Periodic Table Study Aid
========================

A study aid to help students learn their periodic table through an HTML/CSS/Javascript "web app".

Features:
* Options include toggling the atomic number, symbol, or name on and off.
* Clicking on an element on the table displays all the element's information by the options.
* Clicking on the displayed information clears the displayed information.
* Reduced redundancy by generating most of the content through javascript.

Some thing I would like to add:
* Color legend for the different groups of elements
* Instructions
* Change the displayed information from the static position by the options to a floating \<div\> over each element

A working demonstration can be viewed at http://alex-pope.github.com/periodic-table-full/.
